# 🤔 Insurance Fundamental Quiuz and Questions 
A full-stack application for new insurance brokers to help test and prepare for the Insurance Fundamental Quiz.  The user can select the number of questions they would like to practice and randomized questions will populate the quiz.  When the user checks through the stored questions the questions will always be produced in the same order but the reponses will randomize so that the user has to focus on the true response and not on the order.
